# documentation-template
A template documentation for use with any repository to document the project in detail. Most of these points are taken from Steve McConnell's Code Complete.

# Use

1. Copy the files from `/template` to the root of the repository
2. Edit/remove files from the template to suit the context of your project

# What this repository doesn't offer #

1. The `gitignore.git` file. You should choose the relevant gitignore file from [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore) and then make adaptions.
2. A licence. I don't know if you want a licence or which one you want. If you want one, then you'll need to [choose a licence](http://choosealicense.com/) and add it as `LICENCE`.
